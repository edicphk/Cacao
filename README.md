Leveraging Boxstarter and Chocolatey to quickly install most of the tools I use for my daily job!

This is a fork of Laurent Kemp√©'s code and you can read more about it on his blog post "[Automating my development machine installation ](https://laurentkempe.com/2018/06/01/Automating-development-machine-installation/)"

The script leverage 
- Boxstarter [boxstarter.org](http://boxstarter.org)
- Chocolatey [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org)

Some script part were taken from [Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts)
